    "Machine Learning at it's core is fitting a function to data. However, there are many different functions to use, so we need some kind of performance metric to compare them. Therefore in this first exercise, you will will implement  **performance metrics**. In this **first assignment**, we provide you with a set of predictions generated by an (\"unknown\") machine learning system. In addition, you will be also given the true labels (usually referred to as \"ground truth\" data. You will use these to evaluate the performance of the machine.~\n",

    "In the upcoming weeks, we will build on this evaluation metrics to evaluate the performace of a variety of classifiers. In the second exercise, you will learn how to **build your own supervised classifiers**. In extension, the third exercise will take you to **Neural Networks** to classify images. So stay tuned :)\n",

    "## What is Machine Learning and why do we use it?\n",
    "We hope, you're sufficiently amped about AI after the video. While AI and ML are clearly cool, we still have motivate a little bit, why we actually need to use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we are often interested in modelling different phenomenons such as the relationship between a sentence in German and in Mandarin, or an X-Ray image and a cancer diagnosis - you've just seen some more examples in the video. If we are lucky, there already exists a theoretical frameworks, say grammar books or physical models, which allow us to explain these relationships. If $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ are sentences in differnet languages, or $\\mathbf{x}$ the X-ray image (hah!) and $\\mathbf{y}$ the diagnosis (not the Y-ray image), we may already know the relation between  the input $\\mathbf{x}$ and output $\\mathbf{y}$. \n",
    "Unfortunately, for many real world problems we don't really know that relation.\n",
    "However, we still might be able to observe pairs of measurements $(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})$, that can be used for \"learning\".\n",
    "The main goal is to minimize the difference between the **ground truth** ($\\mathbf{y}$) and the **prediction** ($\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}$).\n",

    "## Use-case for Machine Learning: Activity Detection\n",
    "For this exercise, we'll use an interesting real-world use-case example for Machine Learning: **activity detection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last years, fitness trackers and smart watches have grown a lot in popularity.\n",
    "Their main usage is related to personal health - i.e. of monitoring heart rate and tracking daily activity.\n",
    "These devices collect a large amount of different types of physiological data, and measurements will be vary across the different activity phases (standing, walking, sitting, falling,cramps and running). A person's heart rate is usually lower when you are sitting or lying down than when you are standing or exercising.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning methods can be used to \"learn\" the relationships between physiological measurements and activity, what allows us to predict the most likely current activity of a person.\n",
    "This also has practical application, as modern smart watches are able to predict falls of the wearer (think of an old person who is living alone and may require emergency medical assistance), and notify a third party.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Activity Data [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pitasr/falldata) and [study](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/14/6/10691) used in this assignment cover exactly this case.\n"

    "## Task 1.2: Confusion Matrix Computation\n",
    "As you have probably already noticed we are dealing with a classification problem. In machine learning and particular classification the quality of a machine learning model can be evaluated with a variety of distinct quality measures. In order go get an initial idea of how the model behaves we will start by counting and arranging predictions vs. true classes. We can arrange that information as a matrix: each row of the matrix represents the number of instances that the classifier **predicted** per class, while each column represents the instances of the true or **actual** class. This matrix is usually referred to as **confusion matrix** (or sometimes also **error-matrix**). The layout simplifies interpretation and allows us to see how often the model mis-predicts (**confuses**) a samples of a specific class with another class. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Probability Tresholds**\n",
    "\n",
    "For **binary classification**, we can use **thresholding** to switch between classes at a certain threshold value. An intuitive threshold is `0.5`, right in the middle between the two class values `[0,1]`; probabilities below `0.5` are then classified as `0`, everything above as class `1`. Often 0.5 is unfortunately not ideal and results in unaccaptable accuracy/precision/recall/F1 rates.\n",

    "**ROC curves**\n",
    "\n",
    "How could we find better threshold values? A straight-forward method is to just try different trehsholds and eveluate the performance. A more systematic approach is to compute the **ROC** curve. The ROC curve plots the **True-Positive-Rate** or **TPR** against the **False-Positive-Rate** or **FPR**. Each point on the curve is associated to one threshold value. \n",

    "If we return to our example from before, let us assume we only want to classify between `0: all good` and `1: patient has fallen`, we can now use the ROC curve to determine where to separate the two classes. It ultimately faces us with the decision: do we want high TPR - not miss any `patient has fallen` case at the cost of many false alarms. Or do we prefer to miss some fallen patients to keep fals alarms at the minimum? The different performance values may help us take an informed decision, but it remains a design decision. \n",

We won't go too much into detail, consider this: if the classifier can't really tell the two classes apart and the predictions are random, increasing the threshold will increase both true positives and false positives at the same rate. The baseline is therefore a straight line from `(0,0)` to `(1,1)`. The further the ROC curve bends away from that straight line towards the top left, the better the classifier separates the two classes. One quality criterion to evaluate a classifier is tehrefore to compute the **Area under the curve**, or **ROC AUC**. The larger that value is, the better.\n",
