*Generally no difficulties that ocurred.

Except for task 4 I was unsure if we had to use certain list comprehensions or if we could simply solve it with a normal for-loop. Also I noticed that there was a RuntimeWarning since while dividing row.y with row.x, the value of row.x was 2 times very close to 0.0.

Also for task 5 I was not sure if we could use the plot function of the pandas function (which builts on matplotlib) or if we had to use matplotlib. I decided to the pandas plot function.
