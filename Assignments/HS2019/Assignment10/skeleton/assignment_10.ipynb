In our case, we will use the *training set* as the neighbors to base the predictions on. We then use the neighbors to predict the classes of the *test* set and see how well we've done. You've already seen the the figure below, but repetition makes the master, right?\n",

    "If you take a look at the data or pairplot above, you will notice that the general scale of the different *features* is very different. Some are between `1` and `9`, others are smaller than `1`, again others have values larger than `1000`. If you were to compute the euclidean distance between two data points, that translates to the straight line between these points in the 13-dimensional space. It's hard to visualize more than three, but you get the idea. Now, if data in one of the dimensions is by orders of magnitude larger than the others, it dominates the length of that line. That one value determines whether or not two data points are neighbors, although that one dimension might be a really poor indicator for the *similarity* or *closeness* of the objects we compare. Because we usually do not assume to know which features are important, it is generally desirable to treat them all the same. And so, we normalize the data, so that the values of each feature is on the range `[0,1]`. For this case we consider all features are equally important. For our assignment, we'll use `min-max normalization`. \n",

    "Thankfully, it's quite straight forward. We take the features separately, so one column with the same type of data for different `samples` at a time. The feature column $\\mathbf{X}$ has the entries $x_i$. We return normalized entries $z_i$ of the normalized feature column $\\mathbf{Z}$:\n",
